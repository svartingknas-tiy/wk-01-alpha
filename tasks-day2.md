_**All Wizardering Levels**_
Without worrying about positioning, have fun styling your "wk-01-alpha" project, just ensure that you:
- [ ] Include css in each of the three possible ways: imported, style element, embedded.
- Apply styles based on the following selectors and selector combinations:
  - [ ] element
  - [ ] class
  - [ ] id
  - [ ] distinct nested element and class combination (i.e. if applied to element _or_ class _alone_ then additional nodes would be also be styled;  e.g. `p a`)
  - [ ] shared styles (e.g. `p, a`)
- Add styling including at least one instance for each of these **properties**:
  - [ ] width
  - [ ] height
  - [ ] display
  - [ ] margin
  - [ ] padding
  - [ ] border
  - [ ] border-radius
  - [ ] background-color
  - [ ] background-image
  - [ ] color
  - [ ] font-size
  - [ ] font-style
  - [ ] text-align
  - [ ] font-weight
  - [ ] text-decoration
- Use the following measurements at least once:
  - [ ] px
  - [ ] %
  - [ ] rem
  - [ ] em
- [ ] Modify each of the four different anchor states
- Make
  - [ ] small and frequent git commits
  - [ ] with messages following the basic AngularJS Git Commit Msg Convention style (per [Git Commit Messages](https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html))
- [ ] Ensure you've set the GitHub pages to use your "master branch".

_**Skilled Sorcerers && Wise Wizards**_

- [ ] Use `data-[prefix]` with `attr(data-[prefix])` function
- [ ] Use a background gradiant
- [ ] Add and style a table with appropriate content (i.e. tabular data)

****

_**EVERYONE**_

- [ ] Ensure you submit both the GitHub repo url (e.g. https://github.com/[username]-tiy/wk-01-alpha) as your "Assignment URL" _and_ the GitHub pages url (e.g. https://[username]-tiy.github.io/wk-01-alpha) in the notes area.
